# Next Level Week 2: Proffy
<p><b>Proffy</b>, a project from <a href="nextlevelweek.com"><b>Next Level Week</b></a> web dev online event, is a virtual class platform in which students can find teachers to give them classes.</p>
<p>This project doesn't have support for online meetings, it's just a "match platform": students can read teachers' profiles and decide whom they want to choose.</p>
<p>The first part of the event, the one which I'm studying now, is focused on front-end development since Proffy must be a well-designed responsive website.</p>
